### What is this?

OffIt is simple but powerful mocking library based on Retrofit. 

Do you want to build demo of your app without worries about your backend reliability? 
Or maybe you want to prototype your app quickly or just don't have any backend yet?

OffIt is for you!
Make mocks great again.

### How to download?

Simple add OffIt as a dependency in your app level ```build.gradle``` file.

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.gabrielsamojlo.offit:offit:1.0-beta'
}

```

You are ready to go!

### Configuration

First of all, you need to pass your ```RetrofitBuilder``` instance to Offit. Its really simple:

```java
 OffIt.withContext(context).withRetrofitBuilder(retrofitBuilder).build(isMocked).create(ApiService.class);
```

where ```RetrofitBuilder``` is your good, old ```Retrofit``` you are using everyday :

```java
Retrofit.Builder retrofitBuilder = new Retrofit.Builder()
                .baseUrl("http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/")
                .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create());
```

### Mocking

OffIt gives you two ways of mocking your responses. The simple one is just annotating your API Interface without modifying rest of your codebase. The second, more powerful, is using modified classes. In this scenario, changes in your code are necessarily.

#### Basic Mocking ####

Basic mocking is really simple. You need to use ```@Mockable``` annotation to tell OffIt how you want to mock your call :

```java
@GET("/posts/{id}")
@Mockable(responseCode = 200, jsonPath = "get_post.json", responseTime = 1000)
Call<Post> getPost(@Path("id") int postId);
```
That's it. After enabling OffIt, your call will be mocked with data passed to the annotation. And it will behave like the real one!

#### Advanced Mocking ####

Advanced, more powerful, way to mock things up is by using modified ```Call``` and ```CallBack``` classes. 
Together with ```@Mockables``` annotation it gives you ability to use tags so you can mock many case scenarios.

```java
@GET("/posts/{id}")
@Mockables({
            @Mockable(tag = "success", responseCode = 200, jsonPath = "get_post.json", responseTime = 3500),
            @Mockable(tag = "no_post", responseCode = 422, jsonPath = "get_post_error.json", responseTime = 4500)})
com.gabrielsamojlo.offit.Call<Post> getPost(@Path("id") int postId);
```

After that, in your Java code you can execute one of your tagged mockable:

```java
com.gabrielsamojlo.offit.Call<List<Post>> call = mApiService.getPost().withTag("no_post");
        call.enqueue(new com.gabrielsamojlo.offit.Callback<List<Post>>() {
            @Override
            public void onResponse(com.gabrielsamojlo.offit.Call<List<Post>> call, Response<List<Post>> response) {
                // Your code
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailure(com.gabrielsamojlo.offit.Call<List<Post>> call, Throwable t) {
                // Your code
            }
        });
```

In addition, using this method you can easily configure parameters of your mocked call from Java code :

```java
        com.gabrielsamojlo.offit.Call<List<Post>> call = mApiService.getPosts()
                .withResponseTime(100)
                .withResponseCode(404);
```

Of course you can get rid of those ```com.gabrielsamojlo.offit``` prefixes by removing imports to original Retrofit classes.

__Note: all your *.json files should be placed in assets folder!__

### Roadmap
